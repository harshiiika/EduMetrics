```

## 🧮 Core Analytics Logic

### 1. Trend Detection (Linear Regression)
```python
# Analyzes score progression over time
X = assessment_sequence_numbers
y = assessment_scores

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

slope = model.coef_[0]
# Positive slope → Improving
# Negative slope → Declining
# ~Zero slope → Stable
```

**Output:** Categorized as "Strong Improvement", "Moderate Improvement", "Stable", "Slight Decline", or "Needs Attention"

### 2. Performance Prediction (Weighted Moving Average)
```python
# Recent scores weighted higher
recent_scores = [70, 72, 75, 78, 80]  # Last 5 assessments
weights = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]  # Recent = higher weight

predicted_score = weighted_average(recent_scores, weights)
confidence = calculate_confidence(std_deviation)
```

**Output:** Predicted score with confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

### 3. Weak Topic Identification (Data Aggregation)
```python
# Group by subject and topic, calculate averages
topic_performance = assessments.groupby(['subject', 'topic'])['score'].mean()

# Filter topics below threshold
weak_topics = topic_performance[topic_performance < 70]

# Sort by severity
weak_topics_sorted = weak_topics.sort_values()
```

**Output:** Prioritized list of topics needing attention

### 4. Recommendation Engine (Rule-Based Logic)
```python
recommendations = []

# Rule 1: Skill gaps (highest priority)
if weak_topics:
    recommendations.append({
        'priority': 'High',
        'message': f'Focus on: {weak_topics}'
    })

# Rule 2: Study habits
if completion_rate < 70%:
    recommendations.append({
        'priority': 'Medium',
        'message': 'Improve study session completion'
    })

# Rule 3: Time management
if avg_time_per_assessment < 20 minutes:
    recommendations.append({
        'priority': 'Low',
        'message': 'Spend more time on assessments'
    })
```

**Output:** Prioritized, actionable recommendations
